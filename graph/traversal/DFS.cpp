    DFS (Depth-First Search) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses recursion or a stack to traverse a graph.

    Step 3: Traverse all adjacent vertices.
    Step 4: If an adjacent vertex is not visited, call DFS(next_vertex) recursively.
