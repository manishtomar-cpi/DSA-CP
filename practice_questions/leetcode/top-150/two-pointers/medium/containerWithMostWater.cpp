/*
    Greedy Approach Explanation:

    - The problem is to find two lines that, along with the x-axis, form a container holding the most water.
    - Since the area depends on the shorter of the two heights and the distance between them,
      we use a greedy strategy to always choose the better possibility at each step.

    Why it's greedy:
    - We start with the two farthest lines (leftmost and rightmost), which give us the widest possible container.
    - At each step, we compute the area and try to improve it by greedily moving the pointer pointing to the shorter line:
        - Because the current area is limited by the shorter height, moving it might lead to a taller line,
          which can potentially increase the area even if the width decreases.
        - We never move the taller line because doing so cannot help improve the result â€” it would only reduce width
          without gaining height.
    - This way, we greedily make the best local choice (taller potential) in hopes of getting the global maximum.

    MaxArea= height * distance -> here we will take min distance because water cannnot slant(go above) that's why we took min(first, second)*(first-second)

    !Time Complexity: O(n)
    !Space Complexity: O(1)
