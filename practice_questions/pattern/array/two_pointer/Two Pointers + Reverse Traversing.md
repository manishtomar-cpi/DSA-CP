# Pattern: Two Pointers + Reverse Traversing

Used when traversing two sorted arrays from the back (right to left), especially for in-place merging without using extra space.

## Problems Using This Pattern

### [Merge Sorted Array - Example Question](../../../leetcode/top-150/array-string/easy/mergeSortedArray.cpp)

- **Topic**: Array
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Leetcode Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/)
- **Insight**: Compare from the end using two pointers and insert values from the back of `nums1`.
- **Learning**: Helps build intuition for in-place merging and pointer movement from the rear.

## When to Use

- Merging sorted arrays **in-place**
- Avoiding extra space for merging
- Comparing elements from the **end** of arrays
- Working with **sorted arrays**
