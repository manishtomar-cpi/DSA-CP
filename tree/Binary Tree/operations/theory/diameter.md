Let me refine the **algorithm steps** and make them as clear and straightforward as possible for better understanding. Here's the revised and structured **algorithm explanation** added to the markdown file:

# Diameter of a Binary Tree (Iterative Approach)

## Introduction

The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **longest path** between any two nodes in the tree. This path may pass through the root or bypass it entirely. The diameter is measured in terms of the **number of edges** along the path.

---

## Key Metrics:

1. **Height**:
   - The height of a node is `1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight)`.
2. **Diameter at a Node**:
   - The sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees.
3. **Global Diameter**:
   - The largest diameter across all nodes in the tree.

---

## Algorithm

### Objective:

To compute the diameter iteratively using a **postorder traversal simulation**.

### Data Structures:

1. **Stack (`childs`)**:
   - Simulates the system stack used in recursive postorder traversal.
2. **Unordered Map (`height`)**:
   - Stores the height of each node to avoid redundant calculations.
3. **Pointer (`lastVisited`)**:
   - Tracks the last processed node to prevent reprocessing.

---

### Step-by-Step Algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:

   - Create a stack `childs` to simulate postorder traversal.
   - Use an unordered map `height` to store the height of each node.
   - Set `diameter = 0` to track the global diameter.
   - Start traversal from the root.

2. **Postorder Traversal Simulation**:

   - Traverse to the **leftmost node**:
     - Push nodes onto the stack as you move left.
   - Use the stack to simulate recursion and process nodes in postorder.

3. **Node Processing**:

   - Peek at the top node of the stack (`current`).
   - Check if the node's **right subtree is already processed** or if the node has no right child:
     - **If yes**:
       1. Pop the node from the stack.
       2. Retrieve the left and right subtree heights from the height map.
       3. Calculate the height of the current node:
          ```cpp
          height[current] = 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
          ```
       4. Update the diameter:
          ```cpp
          diameter = max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);
          ```
       5. Mark the current node as `lastVisited`.
     - **If no**:
       - Traverse the right subtree by setting `current = current->right`.

4. **Repeat**:

   - Continue until the stack is empty and all nodes are processed.

5. **Return**:
   - The `diameter` variable contains the longest path in the tree.

## Example Walkthrough

### Input Tree:
````

        1
       / \
      2   3
     /
    4

```

---

### Execution Steps:

#### Initialization:
- **Stack (`childs`)**: Empty.
- **Height Map (`height`)**: Empty.
- **Global Diameter (`diameter`)**: `0`.
- Push nodes onto the stack while traversing the left subtree:
```

Stack: [1, 2, 4]

````

---

#### Process Node `4`:
- **Condition**: Node `4` has no left or right child.
- **Actions**:
- Compute height:
  ```cpp
  height[4] = 1;
  ```
- Update diameter:
  ```cpp
  diameter = max(0, 0 + 0) = 0;
  ```
- Mark `4` as processed (`lastVisited = 4`).

---

#### Process Node `2`:
- **Condition**: Node `2`'s right child is `nullptr`.
- **Actions**:
- Compute height:
  ```cpp
  height[2] = 1 + max(1, 0) = 2;
  ```
- Update diameter:
  ```cpp
  diameter = max(0, 1 + 0) = 1;
  ```
- Mark `2` as processed (`lastVisited = 2`).

---

#### Process Node `3`:
- **Condition**: Node `3` has no children.
- **Actions**:
- Compute height:
  ```cpp
  height[3] = 1;
  ```
- Update diameter:
  ```cpp
  diameter = max(1, 0 + 0) = 1;
  ```
- Mark `3` as processed (`lastVisited = 3`).

---

#### Process Node `1`:
- **Condition**: Both left and right subtrees of Node `1` are processed.
- **Actions**:
- Compute height:
  ```cpp
  height[1] = 1 + max(2, 1) = 3;
  ```
- Update diameter:
  ```cpp
  diameter = max(1, 2 + 1) = 3;
  ```

---

### Final Output:
- **Diameter**: `3` (Path: `4 → 2 → 1 → 3`).

## Code

```cpp
int diameter()
{
  stack<BTNode *> childs; // Stack to simulate postorder traversal
  unordered_map<BTNode *, int> height; // Map to store the height of each node
  BTNode *current = root;
  int diameter = 0; // Variable to store the maximum diameter
  BTNode *lastVisited = nullptr; // Tracks the last processed node

  while (!childs.empty() || current)
  {
      // Traverse to the leftmost node
      while (current)
      {
          childs.push(current);
          current = current->left;
      }

      // Process the node at the top of the stack
      current = childs.top();

      // Check if the right subtree is processed or doesn't exist
      if (!current->right || current->right == lastVisited)
      {
          childs.pop();

          // Compute the left and right heights from the map
          int leftHeight = height[current->left];
          int rightHeight = height[current->right];

          // Calculate the height of the current node
          height[current] = 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight);

          // Update the diameter
          diameter = max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);

          // Mark the current node as processed
          lastVisited = current;

          // Set current to nullptr to avoid reprocessing
          current = nullptr;
      }
      else
      {
          // If the right subtree hasn't been processed, traverse it
          current = current->right;
      }
  }

  return diameter;
}
